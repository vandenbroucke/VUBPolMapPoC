VUB PolMap was developed for the course Multimedia seminar, by professor Hichem SAHLI for the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
The source code makes it possible to aqcuire Pollution Matter (PM) data from a PMS7003 sensor through an arduino that's directly powered by your phone. The phone is then able to capture the serial stream of information and display it on a map. You can adapt it to broadcast it to storage servers and more. The repo was tested on a OnePlus 3.
